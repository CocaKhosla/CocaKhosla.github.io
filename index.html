          <p>Every couple of days a new item disappears on the island. Sometimes it's roses, sometimes it's hats. When items disappear, all memories associated with them also disappear. Those who can still remember the items are taken away by The Memory Police and no one knows what happens to them. A young novelist's world turns upside down when her editor's memories fail to disappear. <br>
            Nominated for the International Booker Prizer, Okagawa creates a surreal world where the threat is never visible. There is an odd peace in her writing where you hope that things will turn out for the better, but you have to read to find out.</p>

          <p>The interesting thing about money is that everyone has it, but no one talks about it. It's weird to talk about money. Through <strong>19 features of money</strong>, Morgan Housel tries to make sense of our weird love-hate relationship with money. He doesn't aim to give investment strategies or tell us which stocks to buy. Instead, he teaches us how to treat wealth. One of my favourite lines from the book is as follows: "The bigger the gap between what you want to be true and what you need to be true to have an acceptable outcome, the more you are protecting yourself from falling victim to an appealing financial fiction."</p>

          <p>The website is the coolest and creepiest at the same time. In the library of Babel, there is every possible statement that can ever be said/written or that has ever been said and written. It is INSANE. Upto 3200 characters, everything and anything that you can physically type, is on the website. <br>
          If you don't believe me, search for (without the inverted commas): <strong>'my name is rohan.'</strong> <br>
          You will find it on page 146 of Volume 32 on Shelf 5 of Wall 4 of a Hexagon that starts with <strong>liwt5</strong> and ends with <strong>puxgqq</strong>. I don't understand the theory behind it so if someone does, please do explain it in simple terms. Very cool and creepy website.</p>

          <p>If given a large set of words used in books, one would observe that the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table. This means that the frequency of kth most frequent word is proportional to 1/k times the frequency of the most popular word. In english, the most popular word is <strong>'the'</strong>. The 6th most popular word is <strong>'in'</strong>. That means that the frequency of the word <strong>'in'</strong> in a particular novel/book should be 1/6 times the frequency of the word <strong>'the'</strong>. Somehow, Zipf's law can also be used to develop more accurate NLP models.</p>

          <p>After WW2 ended, the President of the United States realised that there would be an influx of soldiers returning back to the country in search of jobs, homes and families. These men and women were not inclined to return to their parents' house. Instead, they wanted to settle down in their own homes with their own families. But, there would be an incredible shortage of jobs since most of the jobs during the war included those of making weapons, clothes and food. Now, what jobs would remain for these soldiers?<br>
          To answer this, the President lowered the rate of interest on loans. This seemingly small change had a massive impact. Now, soldiers could take loans from banks to buy homes, cars, furniture and appliances. They could afford to send their kids to good schools and attend play golf at the local country club. It was incredible. The average man had the same lifestyle as that of the rich man. The average man drove a Chevy, the rich one drove a Cadillac. Besides that, there was little to no difference between the rich and the average. The new jobs paid better and involved creating products. So people were paid to make more things and with that money buy more things. Now, as the situation got better, banks increased the interest rate of their loans. However, people were still under the impression that they should buy everything their neighbours have and send their kids to the same schools. So they borrowed money from banks (with greater interest). And this compounded over 70 years to get us to where we are now. Fascinating, isn't it.</p>

    <h1>What is <span class="name_in_modal">Incentrop</span> ?</h1>
    <p>When we're kids, we've got this insatiable curiosity. We want to learn new things and we don't mind being bad at something becuase we're technically bad at everything. We ask questions and beg for answers. But as we grow up, we lose this curiosity. Science students refrain from studying the Arts and art students refrain from studying science. We're locked in our own little bubbles of specialisation. That's what I'm trying to burst using <span class="name_in_modal">Incentrop</span>. <br> <br>
    <span class="name_in_modal">Incentrop</span> means my brain's increasing entropy. Yeah, it's a made up word. But, aren't all words made up? Anyways, entropy has a pre-established meaning. It means <strong>random</strong>. Now, I think you understand where I'm going with this. I want to learn about so many different topics that I find fascinating but I often get complacent and procrastinate on the matter. That's where this website comes into picture. I'm trying to use <span class="name_in_modal">Incentrop</span> to post interesting things that I find. The goal is to post once every fortnite. That way, I won't be lazy. Or so I think :) . Given our constantly reducing attention spans, I'll try to keep the posts short and sweet.</p>
