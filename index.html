        <div class="body">
          <p>I've been listening to Kanye West's <strong>Yeezus</strong> recently and I can safely say that his influence on modern day hip-hop is unparalleled. Through Yeezus, Kanye manages to create an soundscape that was well ahead of 2013. He wanted to create an industrial look and feel to the album and partnered with techno artists like Gesaffelstein and long time collaborator Mike Dean. The sampling used by Brockhampton in <strong>Berlin</strong> has drawn great inspiration from Kanye's <strong>I'm In It</strong>. Kanye's biggest disciple, however, lies in Travis Scott. The Rager manages to use progressively escalating harmonies to perfection. It comes as no surprise to know that Travis Scott was actually a part of the Yeezus project with production credits on <strong>New Slaves</strong> and <strong>Guilt Trip</strong> where he worked on the drums. Through the music, Kanye unravels his God Complex. He's proven his doubters wrong by reaching a height musicians can only dream of and through his industrial and minimal soundscape, he tries to describe how difficult it is to live a life of debauchery and excess with yes-men all around you. Even the packaging for for the album is iconic. Unlike his playful <strong>Graduation</strong> album cover designed by Japanese artist Murakami, or the vividly painted covers of <strong>My Beautiiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</strong>, designed by George Condo, Yeezus simply has a disc packaged in a translucent case. The result is something that adds onto the mass production and loss of individualism aspects explored through the soundscape of Yeezus. <br>
          Now, I'm no music expert so I recommend you to go check out the music for yourself. You will not be disappointed.</p>

          <p>Often when people listen to a song they haven't heard in a long time, they talk about how they used to listen to it earlier. They talk about the memories associated with the music. For me, listening to <strong>MBDTF</strong> reminds me of 12th grade exams, <strong>Judaii</strong> reminds me of my competitive tests and <strong>Sorry</strong> by Bieber reminds me of a car ride with my school friends after a day of bowling. They're all memories, some sweet and some painful; but associated with music. That's the power of music, to bring back old memories. Using this logic, scientists and music therapists try to use music to cure Alzheimer's patients. Music has the ability to bring the past into the present. It has the ability to make a person (who has lost their memories) recognise their child after listening to a song they used to dance to in the living room. It's truly incredible.</p>

          <p>Every couple of days a new item disappears on the island. Sometimes it's roses, sometimes it's hats. When items disappear, all memories associated with them also disappear. Those who can still remember the items are taken away by The Memory Police and no one knows what happens to them. A young novelist's world turns upside down when her editor's memories fail to disappear. <br>
            Nominated for the International Booker Prizer, Okagawa creates a surreal world where the threat is never visible. There is an odd peace in her writing where you hope that things will turn out for the better, but you have to read to find out.</p>

          <p>The interesting thing about money is that everyone has it, but no one talks about it. It's weird to talk about money. Through <strong>19 features of money</strong>, Morgan Housel tries to make sense of our weird love-hate relationship with money. He doesn't aim to give investment strategies or tell us which stocks to buy. Instead, he teaches us how to treat wealth. One of my favourite lines from the book is as follows: "The bigger the gap between what you want to be true and what you need to be true to have an acceptable outcome, the more you are protecting yourself from falling victim to an appealing financial fiction."</p>

          <p>The website is the coolest and creepiest at the same time. In the library of Babel, there is every possible statement that can ever be said/written or that has ever been said and written. It is INSANE. Upto 3200 characters, everything and anything that you can physically type, is on the website. <br>
          If you don't believe me, search for (without the inverted commas): <strong>'my name is rohan.'</strong> <br>
          You will find it on page 146 of Volume 32 on Shelf 5 of Wall 4 of a Hexagon that starts with <strong>liwt5</strong> and ends with <strong>puxgqq</strong>. I don't understand the theory behind it so if someone does, please do explain it in simple terms. Very cool and creepy website.</p>

          <p>If given a large set of words used in books, one would observe that the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table. This means that the frequency of kth most frequent word is proportional to 1/k times the frequency of the most popular word. In english, the most popular word is <strong>'the'</strong>. The 6th most popular word is <strong>'in'</strong>. That means that the frequency of the word <strong>'in'</strong> in a particular novel/book should be 1/6 times the frequency of the word <strong>'the'</strong>. Somehow, Zipf's law can also be used to develop more accurate NLP models.</p>

          <p>After WW2 ended, the President of the United States realised that there would be an influx of soldiers returning back to the country in search of jobs, homes and families. These men and women were not inclined to return to their parents' house. Instead, they wanted to settle down in their own homes with their own families. But, there would be an incredible shortage of jobs since most of the jobs during the war included those of making weapons, clothes and food. Now, what jobs would remain for these soldiers?<br>
          To answer this, the President lowered the rate of interest on loans. This seemingly small change had a massive impact. Now, soldiers could take loans from banks to buy homes, cars, furniture and appliances. They could afford to send their kids to good schools and attend play golf at the local country club. It was incredible. The average man had the same lifestyle as that of the rich man. The average man drove a Chevy, the rich one drove a Cadillac. Besides that, there was little to no difference between the rich and the average. The new jobs paid better and involved creating products. So people were paid to make more things and with that money buy more things. Now, as the situation got better, banks increased the interest rate of their loans. However, people were still under the impression that they should buy everything their neighbours have and send their kids to the same schools. So they borrowed money from banks (with greater interest). And this compounded over 70 years to get us to where we are now. Fascinating, isn't it.</p>

    <h1>What is <span class="name_in_modal">Incentrop</span> ?</h1>
    <p>When we're kids, we've got this insatiable curiosity. We want to learn new things and we don't mind being bad at something becuase we're technically bad at everything. We ask questions and beg for answers. But as we grow up, we lose this curiosity. Science students refrain from studying the Arts and art students refrain from studying science. We're locked in our own little bubbles of specialisation. That's what I'm trying to burst using <span class="name_in_modal">Incentrop</span>. <br> <br>
    <span class="name_in_modal">Incentrop</span> means my brain's increasing entropy. Yeah, it's a made up word. But, aren't all words made up? Anyways, entropy has a pre-established meaning. It means <strong>random</strong>. Now, I think you understand where I'm going with this. I want to learn about so many different topics that I find fascinating but I often get complacent and procrastinate on the matter. That's where this website comes into picture. I'm trying to use <span class="name_in_modal">Incentrop</span> to post interesting things that I find. The goal is to post once every fortnite. That way, I won't be lazy. Or so I think :) . Given our constantly reducing attention spans, I'll try to keep the posts short and sweet.</p>
